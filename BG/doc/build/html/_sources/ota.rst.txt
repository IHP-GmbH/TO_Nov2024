1.1. the OTA
the circuit should be used with iHPs PNP-device pnpMPA, so it should be working from VSS. this called for an PMOS input. the design is a simplified version of
:download:`The Recycling Folded Cascode: A General
Enhancement of the Folded Cascode Amplifier <https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Recycling-Folded-Cascode%3A-A-General-Enhancement-Assaad-Silva-Mart%C3%ADnez/dfc8aee088fc6e8f06314452a3a970b6eecb8cf6>`

because of the used CMOS-process the PMOS transistors could have an isolated bulk, without special effort. the simulations showed that the isolated versions had a bigger gain, but a smaller common-mode-range, and i preferred the later.
the bias-current is programmable an so also the band-width. the bias-voltages should allow wide-swing output voltages.
in the space the circuit uses are 3 MiM-capacitors placed. they are intended to use for frequency-compensation or as power-rail decoupling.

simulations

using different bias-currents of 1, 3 and 10ÂµA a few simulations are printed into a PDF that allow to see the gain, common-mode-range, bandwidth and a slew-rate:

ETHZ feedback
########################

its a bit stupid to design OTAs that fit in a square, if there is no such space-requirement. the layout should be changed to minimize the conductor-length of the signals between the differential-stage and the current-mirrors.
